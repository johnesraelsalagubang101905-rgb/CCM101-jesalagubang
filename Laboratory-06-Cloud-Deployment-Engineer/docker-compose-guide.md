# Docker Compose Guide: Nextcloud + MariaDB


## The Compose File

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  database:
    image: mariadb:10.6
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=cloudnova_root
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=cloudnova_pass
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud_db
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud_user

  app:
    image: nextcloud
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    environment:
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=cloudnova_pass
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud_db
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud_user
      - MYSQL_HOST=database
```

## What does the `services:` block do?

The `services:` block defines every container that makes up the application. Each entry under it (`database` and `app`) is one service, with its own image, environment variables, and port settings. Docker Compose reads this block and creates, networks, and starts all the containers together. It also puts them on a shared default network automatically.

## How did the Nextcloud container find the database?

The `MYSQL_HOST=database` variable tells Nextcloud which host to connect to. Compose creates a private network for the stack and registers each service name as a DNS hostname on it. The name `database` therefore resolves to the MariaDB container's IP address, so no IP address has to be hardcoded.

The `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, and `MYSQL_DATABASE` values are identical in both services so that Nextcloud logs in with the account MariaDB created.

## `docker run` vs `docker-compose up -d`

| | `docker run` | `docker-compose up -d` |
|---|---|---|
| Scope | Starts one container | Starts every service in the file |
| Configuration | Long command with flags (`-p`, `-e`, `--name`) | Stored in a reusable YAML file |
| Networking | Must be created and linked manually | Created automatically |
| Repeatability | Easy to mistype or forget flags | Same result every time; can be version-controlled |
| Cleanup | Stop and remove each container separately | `docker-compose down` removes the whole stack |

The `-d` flag runs the containers in the background (detached mode).
